<li>No food, beverages, or tobacco products are allowed in lab at any
time. Do not chew gum in lab (chemicals can potentially bind to the
gum). Never taste a chemical/substance in lab. There is table outside
the door to the lab where you can leave items of this nature for the
duration of each lab period.</li>

</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>By federal law, students have the right to know about all chemicals
(including consumer products) they will be exposed to in lab. It is your
responsibility to know where to access this information. Safety data
sheets (SDSs) provide detailed technical safety information for all
chemicals/products used in lab. These are available for anyone who wants
more information about a chemical/product than is required on a label.
There is a binder containing this information located on the side bench
near the lab door. Additional information is available in the chemical
stockroom of the Biology Department and may be looked up online</li>
<li>All hazardous products will be identified clearly with a label;
however, it is good common sense to treat all chemicals as though they
are hazardous.</li>
<li>Always label solutions, test tubes, and containers you are using in
a way that others can tell what is contained within them.</li>
<li>Never return chemicals to the container where you got them.</li>
<li>Keep flammable chemicals away from open flames, hotplates, and other
sources of heat or sparks.<br>
</li>
<li>Dispose of chemicals as instructed (waste bottles will be provided
when necessary).</li>

<h2 id="section-5--safety-goggles-gloves">Section 5. Safety Goggles &amp; Gloves<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#section-5--safety-goggles-gloves"></a>
</h2>
<p>For laboratory exercises that incorporate dissection or exposure to
chemicals that pose a health risk as determined in the chemical SDS,
students will be required to have and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) as described below. These will be provided by
the instructor, including approved goggles and gloves. These PPE may not
be required for every laboratory period, but if you are issued such PPE,
you are responsible for having them with you to participate in labs that
require them.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>DO NOT handle personal electronic devices or other personal items
while wearing gloves. Do not touch your face while wearing gloves. Doing
so contaminates your property and defeats the purposes of wearing gloves
in the first place.</li>
<li>For in-laboratory exercises that include a significant splash
hazard, students will be required to have safety goggles meeting the
specified safety standards as described: The following is required for
goggles in laboratory settings when noted by the instructor:
<ul>
<li>Must be indirectly vented and must provide splash protection.</li>
<li>Must not have fabric or foam around edges that can absorb liquids
and hold it next to the wearer’s skin.<br>
</li>
<li>Must meet the ANSI Z87.1-2003 safety impact standard.</li>
<li>No admittance to the lab without approved goggles (if the specific
lab requires goggles). Goggles will be provided if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following is required for gloves in laboratory settings when
noted by the instructor:
<ul>
<li>Must be appropriate for the current exposure to the hazardous
chemical.</li>
<li>For splash or intermittent contact protection, a disposable Nitrile
glove 9.5” long and 4 mil thick is recommended for most situations.
Disposable gloves will be made available for your use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Footwear MUST have a closed toe and heel that prevents the shoe from
coming off and protects the skin on your feet. NO sandals in lab because
of danger from broken glass and chemical spills.</li>
<li>Generally, there is no required attire for laboratories. However,
loose and baggy clothing may constitute a fire hazard, soak up spilled
chemicals, or get caught on equipment. Additionally, at times, you will
be dealing with chemicals that may stain or burn your skin. Use common
sense when choosing what to wear for lab; shorts and bare midriffs are
generally not good choices.<br>
</li>
<li>Long hair should be tied back to reduce the risk of fire hazard and
to keep hair out of chemicals.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="section-7--housekeeping">Section 7. Housekeeping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#section-7--housekeeping"></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Keep your workspace clean and neat.</li>
<li>You are required to wipe down your portion of the lab bench before
leaving lab.</li>
<li>Return ALL lab equipment to its proper place. A good rule of thumb
is to put everything back where you found it, cleaner than you found
it.</li>
<li>All trash must be thrown away in identified receptacles. Do not
throw trash into sinks.</li>
<li>All broken glass must be put into an appropriate container; broken
glass containers are located in the front corner of the room.</li>
<li>Never point at models, skeletal material, or specimens using a pen
or pencil. Marks are often impossible to remove without further
damage.</li>
<li>Always put used scalpel blades, syringe needles, etc., into the red
sharps container in the front of the room.</li>
<li>Clean up non-hazardous chemical spills immediately. If the chemical
may be hazardous, notify the instructor and clean up using proper
procedures as described by the instructor.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-8--microscopes-stereoscopes">Section 8. Microscopes &amp; Stereoscopes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#section-8--microscopes-stereoscopes"></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Microscopes and stereoscopes must be returned to their cabinets in
the correct orientation.</li>
<li>Always use two hands to carry microscopes and stereoscopes.</li>
<li>Do not allow microscope/stereoscope cords to dangle where they might
become tangled or tripped over.</li>
<li>Keep microscopes/stereoscopes away from the edge of the table.</li>
<li>Use lens paper ONLY to clean the lenses; clean them often. At a
minimum, clean all lenses with first use during a laboratory period and
the ocular lenses between different users. Never allow your eyes to
touch the ocular lenses.<br>
</li>
<li>Slides: Never carry more than one microscope slide at a time.
Carrying stacks of slides results in broken coverslips and ruins the
slides. Many of our microscope slides cannot be replaced and those that
can are expensive. Put any chipped or broken slides immediately into the
broken glass container. Some breakage is a natural result of using
equipment. Notify the lab instructor so that they can keep track of
slide numbers and reorder them if possible. Always return slides to
where you got them.</li>

<h2 id="section-9--specimens">Section 9. Specimens<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#section-9--specimens"></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Abuse of specimens, living or preserved, carries severe
consequences, including immediate dismissal from class and, depending on
severity of the abuse, up to and including failure of the course.</li>
<li>Live specimens need to be treated humanely and respectfully. If
unsure how to handle an organism, ask the instructor.</li>
<li>Treat all microorganisms as potential pathogens.</li>
<li>All used cultures/plates containing bacteria should be disposed of
ONLY in locations designated for materials to be autoclaved.</li>
<li>Preserved specimens should be treated respectfully and NEVER REMOVED
from lab. Specimens themselves and preservatives pose a potential health
risk. Removing specimens or parts of specimens from labs is theft and
will result in immediate dismissal from class with a grade of “F”
assigned for the course. Additional legal action may be taken by Oberlin
College, if warranted. All dissection tissue remnants should ONLY be
disposed of in locations designated by the instructor. Do NOT throw them
in sinks or general-use trashcans.</li>

<li>In accordance with CDC guidelines and recommendations from the
governor of Ohio, face masks may be worn indoors for added personal
safety. This includes in the lab setting if you choose.</li>
<li>During the lab session, wash your hands often and thoroughly using
soap and water.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the lab session, use paper towels (provided) to
thoroughly wipe down your space and your materials.</li>
<li>To date, more scientific papers have been published on COVID-19 and
its vaccines since 2020 than cumulative papers have been published on
Staphylococcus in the last 140 years. History shows that vaccines work
(polio, smallpox, etc), and the literature and data show that this
particular vaccine is effective in protecting humans (references
available upon request). If you can, and if it is recommended for your
particular situation – Get vaccinated. If not for yourself, for those
around you. Ask your instructor if you want more information about how
to do this.</li>

<li>Several of our class periods this semester may take place in the
field. Appropriate dress is required for these activities—generally,
long pants, long sleeves, and shoes that cover your feet are highly
recommended. Wearing inappropriate clothes will not preclude you from
the lab activity.</li>
<li>Bring water, sunscreen, and bug spray.</li>
<li>While in the field, be aware that the terrain is rough and
uneven.</li>
<li>Be aware of where you step. Watch for snakes and other venomous
creatures.</li>
<li>If you become injured or feel ill, let the instructor know
immediately.</li>
<li>No dangerous horseplay or activities will be tolerated.</li>
