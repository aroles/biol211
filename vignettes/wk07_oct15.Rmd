# Arthropod Identification

This week, we are focusing on finishing the IDs for our specimens. Our goal is to have all IDs finished by Friday Oct 18th. If your team finishes yours, you can help with someone else's samples.

Remember you also have one more Burlese funnel sample to filter for ID! Be sure to clean your glassware as you are finisihed with it and put it out to dry.

Below, we outline the current calendar of lab activities.

Note that there is an assigment due the week after break -- finishing the R videos (see below).

# Assignment due Oct 29/30

* Complete videos 5-7 of the [Intro to R sequence](articles/intro2r.html)
* Complete the Intro2R Assignment 2 
* Finish identifying specimens ASAP!
