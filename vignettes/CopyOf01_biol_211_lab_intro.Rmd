## Introduction to BIOL 211 Lab

* [Syllabus](https://aroles.github.io/biol211/index.html)

## Lab Safety


## Scientific Method

Designing effective research requires you to follow the **scientific method**.

* Asking a **question** – why or how something happens?

* **Hypothesis** – a fancy name for an educated guess about what causes something to happen.

* **Prediction** – what you think will happen if hypothesis is true.

* **Testing** – this is where you get to experiment and be creative.

* **Conclusion** – decide how your test results relate to your predictions.

* **Communicate** – share your results so others can learn from your work.

```{r neg loop img, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7, fig.cap = "**Figure 1**: The scientific method. (adapted from Arizona State University: Ask A Biologist)", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(here::here(), 'man', 'figures', 'sci_method.jpg'), dpi = 100)
```

## Class Logistics

Each week we will conduct a part of one or more steps of the scientific process to answer a question related to the basic ecology of insect and plant communities.

After each lab meeting, you will have an assignment to do that will help prepare for the next lab meeting and will be due before that meeting. Additionally, after each lab meeting, you will have to do a reflection on what you did during lab.

For field and lab methods, you may have to conduct some of them outside of normal lab times. This is because some of the protocols require data collection after 24-48hrs or identification that may take longer than a single lab meeting. If there is need to use the lab room, make sure to work with your instructor to make sure the room is available.

At the end of each research project you will need to give 15 minute oral presentation to the rest of your class. In your presentations your will summarize what you did, why you did it, your results, and the conclusion(s) you have made based on your results. There will also be about 5 minutes after your presentation for your classmates and instructor to ask you questions about your work.

## Lab Notebook

For this lab you will be required to keep a lab notebook.

Key points in keeping a Lab Notebook:

1.	Neat and legible handwriting in dark ink; not pencil if able

2.	Procedure/Study title and purpose clearly stated

3.	Methods described clearly and succinctly, with errors and steps taken to correct them

4.	Calculations performed neatly showing intermediate steps

5.	Errors crossed out with a single line

6.	All pages dated at the top and numbered at the bottom

When making a Lab Notebook, make sure to leave enough room at the beginning for a table of contents. Every new procedure, experiment, notes, calculation, etc. should start on a new page with that page being the front of the right page (i.e. the odd-numbered pages). These new pages will be what is recorded in the table of contents for each procedure, experiments, set of notes, etc. For the sake of being able to easily find a specific date or page number, the date should be recorded at the right-hand side of the top of the page and the page number should be written at the right-hand side of the bottom of the page.

All information about a procedure, experiment, notes, calculation, etc. should be recorded in the Lab Notebook. These entries should be accompanied by a brief description of what it is. If the data collected by a computer is too large to record in the notebook then the name of the data file and where it is located should be recorded along with the location of any backups/copies made.

Information in a Lab Notebook should never be completely removed from the book. Mistakes, such as misspellings, should be crossed out with a single line and initialed. It is also good practice to give a short (only a few words) reason the change was made.

For this course the Field Notebook will be transcribed into the electronic lab notebook every week. This allows the instructors and your lab group to access the information and data you gather over the course of the semester. Additionally, this provides a back up in case you lose or misplace your field notebook. The electronic lab notebook we will be using is called [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/) which can be accessed [HERE](https://www.benchling.com/).

# Insect Ecology

Article about the importance of insects in forests:

* [Kitching, R.L., Dahlsjö, C.A. and Eggleton, P., 2020. Invertebrates and the complexity of tropical ecosystems. Biotropica, 52(2), pp.207-214.](sheets/sci_articles/Kitching_et_al_2020.pdf)

# Assignment

Each person in your group must find a different scholarly source and provide a short summary of the information provided in the source. The citation for your source along with the summary are due before next week's lab. 

You should turn these in using the link in the "Lab Assignment Turn In" drop down menu at the top of the page. Make sure to use the link for your lab section (i.e., if your section meets on Tuesday then you should use the "Tuesday Lab Section" link and if your section meets on Wednesday then you should use the "Wednesday Lab Section" link). 

Your first assignment for lab is to read "[The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research](sheets/sci_articles/Importance_of_stupidity.pdf)" which can be downloaded [HERE](sheets/sci_articles/Importance_of_stupidity.pdf).
