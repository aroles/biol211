# Welcome to the BIOL 211 Lab for Fall 2024!

## Laboratory Class Meetings

Lab: Tuesday or Wednesday, 1:30-4:20pm in Sci Ctr K119

Before each lab meeting *you are required* to read through the resources provided for that week before class. You can find these resources by following the links in the [Lab Schedule](#lab-schedule) section below or via the "Lab Resources" drop down menu at the top of the page.

Bring your laptop to all lab meetings, as most assignments will be submitted electronically

## Course Objectives

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Appreciate how scientists collect and use data to study topics such as adaptation, population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystems.

* Conduct basic ecological research on concepts central to ecology.

* Apply all parts of the scientific method to ecological questions.

* Formulate a hypothesis with testable predictions.

* Interpret graphical presentations of empirical relationships and theoretical models.

* Use R to create graphs and carry out statistical analyses of data.

* Analyze and communicate the results of an experiment.

## Required Laboratory Materials

All materials will be provided weekly by instructors, posted to here on the course website or Blackboard, usually on Fridays of the week prior to the lab. Laptops will be useful for many lab meetings

## Lab Assignments

Unless you are told otherwise by your instructor, all assignments should be handed in electronically. Links to where you need to turn them in can be found at the top of the page under the "Lab Assignment Turn In" drop down menu.

All assignments need to be submitted as a single PDF, Word Document, or Google Doc. DO NOT submit a Pages file. 

**MAKE SURE TO WRITE YOUR NAME(S) ON THE ASSIGNMENT AND WRITE AND SIGN THE OBERLIN HONOR CODE**.

It is recommended to copy and paste the questions into another document and answer them.
