</h2>
<p>This section is aimed at providing guidelines for the treatment of
data while and after it is collected. During this period, data is the
most vulnerable to loss or other issues that decrease its usefulness.
Therefore, proper data management during this period is absolutely
essential!</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data should be recorded with dark pen and never erased or
scratched out</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When collecting data, a dark inked pen should be used. This ensures
that information will not be lost due to pencil lead being rubbed off.
Additionally, pen forces changes made to the data in the field to be
tracked on the page (i.e. you cannot erase). If a mistake is made, the
mistake should be crossed out with a single line and the initials of the
person making the change written near the change. Information should
NEVER be scratched out so much that the information being changed cannot
be recovered.</p>
<p>If you are worried about rain or water damage to your data sheets,
then you should use All-Weather paper and an archival or All-Weather
pen. However, these types of pens can be expensive, so a pencil can be
used when necessary (with the permission of the PIs or project lead). If
a pencil is used, the data recorder needs to press hard enough that the
pencil writes as dark as possible. The same guidelines for making
changes in the field should be followed so that the changes can be
tracked.</p>
<p>After each day of data collection in the field, the data sheets
should be legibly photographed or scanned and saved to your project
Drive Folder. This provides the most basic back up that you can go to if
data is lost.</p>
<p>For audio-visual data, information about the data, such as the date,
time, study name, person taking the recording and any other information
necessary for the independent comprehension of the data, should be
included as a message in the frame for images or at the start of video
and audio recording. This makes the file self-identifying in case that
information is lost elsewhere. For remotely collected audio-visual data,
this can be done immediately after the data is collected (see the <a href="#data-formatting">Data Formatting</a> section).</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="lab-data">Lab Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lab-data"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data collected in the lab should kept together in a lab
notebook and recorded in dark ink</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Data collected in a lab should be collected in Lab Notebooks. Lab
Notebooks can be actual notebooks and will be provided by the PI (please
ask if they are not readily available). Binders should be avoided when
possible in lieu of bound notebooks because pages area easily removed
from or fall out of binders. If you a collecting data for the
development of a product for patenting, then you are required to use a
bound notebook and to review the institution’s policy on lab notebooks.
Since ecological research rarely produces patented products, we will not
give guidelines for keeping a legal lab notebook. However, if you want
more information on this, then it is recommended you review “Writing the
Laboratory Notebook” by Howard Kanares (<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED344734.pdf" class="external-link">LINK</a>).</p>
<p>Key points in keeping a Lab Notebook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Neat and legible handwriting in dark ink; not pencil if
able</p></li>
<li><p>Procedure/Study title and purpose clearly stated</p></li>
<li><p>Methods described clearly and succinctly, with errors and steps
taken to correct them</p></li>
<li><p>Calculations performed neatly showing intermediate steps</p></li>
<li><p>Errors crossed out with a single line, initialed, and briefly
explained</p></li>
<li><p>All pages dated at the top and numbered at the bottom</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When making a Lab Notebook, make sure to leave enough room at the
beginning for a table of contents. Every new procedure, experiment,
notes, calculation, etc. should start on a new page with that page being
the front of the right page (i.e. the odd-numbered pages). These new
pages will be what is recorded in the table of contents for each
procedure, experiments, set of notes, etc. For the sake of being able to
easily find a specific date or page number, the date should be recorded
at the right-hand side of the top of the page and the page number should
be written at the right-hand side of the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>All information about a procedure, experiment, notes, calculation,
etc. should be recorded in the Lab Notebook. This includes data recorded
on or collected with a computer system. The data should be printed out
and taped (never glued) into the Lab Notebook on the appropriate page.
These entries should be accompanied by a brief description of what it
is. If the data collected by a computer is too large to print and tape
into the notebook then the name of the data file and where it is located
should be recorded along with the location of any backups/copies
made.</p>
<p>As with the collection of field data, information in a Lab Notebook
should never be completely removed from the book. Mistakes, such as
misspellings, should be crossed out with a single line and initialed. It
is also good practice to give a short (only a few words) reason the
change was made.</p>
<p>Lab Notebooks should <strong>NEVER</strong> be taken out of the lab
or the project lead’s possession. Ideally, Lab Notebooks should be kept
in a cabinet/drawer in the lab space so that collaborators can easily
find them. However, it is also acceptable for lab notebooks to be kept
in the office of the project lead. To protect against Lab Notebooks
being removed from the lab, digital scans or photographs of the
notebook’s pages should be created periodically (ideally weekly). This
allows for the consultation of the Lab Notebook when not in the lab and
acts as a backup of the information in the notebook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-transcription">Data Transcription<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-transcription"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digitize and back up data soon after
collection</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, the data should be transcribed into a computer each day
after collection as well. If that is not possible, then data should be
transcribed weekly. This makes transcribing data easier and reduces the
chances for transcription errors for multiple reasons. First, data will
not pile up, and when data piles up and transcribed all at once, errors
are more likely due to rushing and fatigue. Lastly, regular data
transcription helps for understanding messy handwriting in the field.
The data will still be fresh in the mind of the researcher and any
temporary technicians will still be around, both of which are important
for deciphering handwriting.</p>
<p>If multiple people are transcribing data, then they should each be
working with separate but identically formatted spreadsheets. This
reduces the risk of someone accidentally overwriting or deleting data.
It is then the responsibility of the data manager or project lead to
compile this data in a reproducible way (e.g. with R script or detailed
methodology). The compilation of data can occur whenever the data
manager deems it necessary.</p>

<h3 id="data-proofing">Data Proofing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-proofing"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A secondary check by someone who did not enter the data
should be done</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After data has been entered, someone who did not enter the data
should compare the hand-written data sheet(s) to the entered data. When
doing this, there should be a proofing column(s) in the data file that
gets checked off once the data has been checked, and has notes for
corrections and/edits that were made as well as a column for the
reviewer’s names or initials. Again this is most important for when
there are many researchers entering data but will always help to catch
and correct any errors early. If there is only one researcher entering
data, then having that researcher go back and recheck the data they have
already entered at a later date (e.g. a week later) is a easy way to do
data proofing even on a small project.</p>
<p>If there is too much data for the data proofing stage to be
reasonably done, then a random subset of the data entered by each data
transcriber should be proofed.</p>
<p>Further proofing will also be done during data formatting (see the <a href="#data-formatting">Data Formatting</a> section) and should be
always be done before analysis.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-formatting">Data Formatting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-formatting"></a>
</h2>
<p>This section provides the guidelines for how to build and format data
tables so that they are easily manipulated, edited, analyzed, and most
importantly understood. In addition, we will discuss the proper
formatting of other types of data as well such as spatial and
audio-visual data. The formatting outlined in this section should be
established well before the final version of the data is made meaning
that the early files that are being manipulated/edited do not
necessarily have to be formatted this way. However, it is highly
recommended that the data (especially data tables) be formatted
following these guidelines during the first edit (i.e. the edit(s)
creating version 1).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-tables">Data Tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-tables"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data tables should be saved as CSV files and be in long
format</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Column headers are required, should be consistent, and
easy to understand</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>All text should be formatted consistently with dates in
the YYYY-MM-DD format</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>All cells should have values and if a value is missing
then an NA should be entered</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All data tables should be saved as a comma delimited file (never tab
delimited) such as a CSV (comma separated values) file. The reason for
this is that Excel files may not be able to be easily read by
researchers without Microsoft Office. This is also the same for other
proprietary file types such as Access. If you are using a relational
database software, such as Access, then the various tables should also
be saved as CSV files. This is also true for data stored in R file types
(e.g. Rdata), because not everyone knows how to use R.</p>
<p>Even though CSV and comma delimited text files are essentially the
same, CSV files are the preferred format for data tables over text files
because the .csv extension provides an easy way to sort or filter out
the data files since the documentation files (see the File Documentation
section) are often saved as text file (.txt extension). Additionally,
CSV files are readable by most software and easy to load into most
computer programs.</p>
<p>Data tables should always be in a long format unless a long format is
too cumbersome (e.g. large community data). A long-formatted data table
is a table where one row corresponds to the minimum observable unit of
data (e.g. a single trial for an individual in a repeated behavioral
assay) that has multiple rows for grouping factors (e.g. individual) and
single columns for data (e.g. choice). However, even if long formats
seem too cumbersome, long formats are better than wide for many reasons.
Specifically, long formats allow for the easy conversion to other
formats. Long formats also allow for the easy aggregation, subsetting,
and analysis.</p>
<p>Below is an example of data in a long format:</p>

</table>
<p>Every data table is REQUIRED to have column headers. Column headers
should be short and easy to understand. Avoid using symbols and
abbreviations whenever possible. For example, instead of using ‘dc’ to
denote the distance to Cuba, use ‘distance_cuba’. Abbreviations are
helpful, especially during analysis coding, but can lead to difficulties
in comprehension. Make sure that if you use abbreviations you use
common, easy to understand abbreviations. For instance, instead of
‘distance_cuba’ we could use ‘dist_cuba’ since “dist” is an often-used
abbreviation for distance. Here at the iEco Lab we prefer you to not use
abbreviations except for instances when the column header is very long
(a general guideline is that headers should be no more than 15
characters and therefore ‘distance_cuba’ is not too long). Additionally,
for column headers, spaces should be replaced with an underscore
(i.e. “_”). Some analysis software and R functions cannot handle spaces
in column headers, which can cause the data to erroneously load or
return errors. Column header conventions should be made for individual
projects with multiple data tables or for whole labs. Column header
conventions help to make data easily combined for analysis and
understood.</p>
<p>Column headers also should not include units. The units of
measurement should be included in you meta data for that file. If you
have multiple columns that have the same data but different units that
are easy to convert (e.g. m and km) then delete one of those columns and
convert in your analysis code if needed. The only exception to not
having units in the header is if you have the same data with different
units that are not easily converted between each other and are on very
different scales (e.g. atmospheric pressure, temperature), or if for
some reason you need both metric and imperial units (e.g. for making
maps for US and non-US users).</p>
<p>The format of any text (including numbers) in your data table should
be as basic as possible. The file types that should be used (i.e. csv or
text files) strip all formatting from any text. This can cause issues if
you use special characters, symbols, and fonts. Therefore, all special
characters and symbols should be avoided. Additionally, most analysis
software do not know how to read special characters or symbols.</p>

<p>For text strings (column headers and factors with more than 1
character) avoid using capitalized letters where possible. If you do use
capital letters, make sure you are consistent with how you use them. For
example, if you have binomial species names and you capitalize the genus
but not the species, then make sure you use that same framework
throughout. In the above example the first letter of each word in the
species name is capitalized throughout that column. However, a good rule
of thumb to follow is to never use capitalization where possible.</p>
<p>Entry IDs should be included in all tables you produce. Entry IDs are
unique identifiers for each entry (i.e. row) in a data table. This
allows for easy tracking of specific changes you make to the data as
well as allowing for the easy creation of relational keys between your
data tables for easy merging. Avoid just using simple row numbers for
these IDs. Good entry IDs are alpha-numeric text strings that provides
some information about the entry, allows for easy sorting, and should be
the same number of characters for each entry. These IDs should not be
typed in with the data and be simple (few numbers and characters) or
complex. It is often easiest to make IDs by concatenating multiple
columns together with a separating symbol.</p>
<p>For example, a good entry ID for the first entry in the above table
would be “20200424_A_02_M” which tells us that entry is for site A, the
second species alphabetically, is male, and was made on a particular
survey day. We could also use that ID to sort so that the sites and
species within those sites are alphabetical from the earliest survey to
the last.</p>
<p>Entry IDs should also be unique to the data table meaning that the ID
scheme should not be repeated across tables that may be later joined.
The entry ID should be created at some point before the final version of
the data is created. The timing at which the entry ID is made depends on
the specific needs of the project and data editing. Once the entry ID is
made then it is set for the entire lifetime of the data and should not
be change. However, it is recommended to create the entry ID after all
of the large edits to the data are made. This is because if large
sections of data are deleted then you will have large gaps in the entry
ID series. Do not worry about adding data after an entry ID is created
since it is easy to just continue the series where you left off.
Importantly, entry IDs should never be recycled even if an entry has
been deleted. This could make following the change logs difficult.</p>
<p>Dates in data tables should be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, and no
other format should be used. In the above table the format used for the
date is MM/DD/YYYY. This format is bad for multiple reasons. First, not
every culture and, therefore, their computers use that format. In many
regions, the day comes before the month (i.e. DD/MM/YYYY). This can
cause issues for dates like 4/5/2020. Is that April 5th or is it May
4th? Computers in different cultures will also ask that question and may
just assume that the first number is the day or month depending on its
default setting. The year-month-day format with dashes in between the
year, month, and day is understood by all computers and software.
Additionally, by having dates in the YYYY-MM-DD you can easily sort your
data by date. When including years in dates they always should be 4
digits so that 2020 is not confused with 1920. If you like having the
character form of months (e.g. March or Mar) in your data tables, then
you should have that separate from the date in a new column.</p>
<p>Missing data should be handled the same throughout the data table.
This includes any comment columns you have in the table.
<strong>NEVER</strong> leave cells blank for missing data. Blank cells
have an ambiguous meaning since they could mean that there was no data
for that cell, the cell was accidentally deleted, or it was erroneously
skipped over during transcription. Instead, use something like ‘NA’ to
denote missing data. It is preferred to use ‘NA’ to denote missing data
since it is read by R software in that way. No matter what is the cause
of the missing data (e.g. data not recorded, data not able to be
recorded, etc.), missing data should always by represented by an NA. If
it is important for the project to differentiate between different
causes of NAs then this should be recorded in a ‘notes’ or ‘comments’
column. If a specific value is wanted to denote a certain cause of
missing data (e.g. NR for data not recorded), then that should be a
decision made by the PI and Project Lead. However, be careful when
reading this data into statistical software since they will not know
what that value (e.g. NR) means and will likely read it as a character
making the whole column a character variable.</p>
<p>When creating data tables, the most important thing is the data to be
consistent and the nature of the data recorded in the meta data file
(see File Documentation section). For example, species names should
always be either only common or only scientific in a single column, and
in comment columns, if a comment means the same thing, it should be kept
the same (e.g. “date not recorded” is always entered, and never “date
was not recorded”, “date missed”, “unrecorded date” and so on). Further,
in comments DO NOT use commas to separate clauses. This is because in
CSV files, commas are used to separate each field (i.e. column).</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure that there are no leading or trailing spaces in
your data. This can cause some software to mess up your data or treat
text strings as separate levels of a factor even if they are identical
except for a trailing or leading space.</p>
<p>Now if we rework the above example table into the ideal formatting it
will look like:</p>

<th align="left">entry_id</th>
<th align="left">date</th>

<p>Now this table does not have any uppercase letters, has an
informative alpha-numeric entry ID, the data is formatted correctly, and
the headers are appropriate (i.e. ‘Species’ was changed to ‘common’ and
there are no uppercase letters).</p>
